# 2021-translatable_form

Vue 3 form component utilising JSON language data to replace form labels and headers from user interface.

## Comments

Data is retreived via asyncronus axios requests which can be altered to use an api or database if neccessary. One set of data (Pirate) is incomplete and handled as a special case. No css preprocessor or library was utilised due to small scope of project. Validation of form data and user feedback can be implemented on request but was not handled here.
